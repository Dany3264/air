Air Quality in Delhi in january
Air quality index (AQI) analysis is a crucial aspect of environmental data science, this is my first approach to the matter and I can already see how can I leverage this example to
any other locations, timeline, previous or even a model to predict pollutants concentration.
Having the base functions, and categorizing the AQI, makes easier to gather the data of the location in interest and conduct the analysis.

I've used a Line plot, a Bar plot, a Correlation Matrix and a Pie chart to show the different concentrations-distributions of the different pollutants present in this case of study.
